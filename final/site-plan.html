			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>This site is going to be a simple picture puzzle game. The picture will be split into a grid and shuffled and the user will have to swap 2 pieces at a time until the image is complete.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The audience will be anyone looking for a quick to play puzzle game.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>If possible, I'd like to split an image automatically into different squares, but if I can't figure it out I'll just manually save the individual grid squares separately using some sort of naming scheme. Regardless of how dynamic the game is set up, the javascript will have to a) allow the user to swap two pieces by clicking two squares in sequence and b) check if the puzzle is complete. If I have time I'd like to create a hard mode too, using a 7x7 square instead of a 4x4 square in the default difficulty, and that would be chosen with a button on the main screen.</p>
            <p>The script will also have to save the user's choices on the home screen and determine the puzzle based on those choices, as well as lock the play button until the user has chosen a difficulty and image.
            </p>

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
